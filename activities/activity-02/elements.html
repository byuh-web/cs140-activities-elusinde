    <p>Sometimes it's the first moment of the day that catches you off <br>
        guard. That's what Wendy was <em>thinking</em>. She opened her window to see <br>
        fire engines screeching down the street. While this wasn't something <br>
        completely unheard of, it also wasn't <strong>normal</strong>. <blockquote>It was a sure sign of what
        was going to <mark>happen that day</mark>. She could feel it in her <b>bones</b> and it wasn't
        the way she wanted the day to begin.</p></blockquote>
