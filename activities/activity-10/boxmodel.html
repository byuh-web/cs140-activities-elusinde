        What is normal flow in HTML?
            Normal flow is the way elements are arranged on a page with no css applied.
        What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?
            float moves things to the side(left or right) and allows other content to wrap around it. You need to clear it because it changes how the page normally flows.
        OPTIONAL++What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?
            relative: can be moved but still takes up the same amount of space in normal flow.
            abolute: not in normal flow, item relative to other things on the page.
            fixed: not in normal flow and relative to viewport. stays in place when scrolling.
        OPTIONAL++How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?
        I HOPE YOU KNOW!!++Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?
